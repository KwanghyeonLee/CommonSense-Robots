# CommonSense-Robots

#### This repository organizes researches related to AI Technology Development for Commonsense Extraction, Reasoning, and Inference from Heterogeneous Data, especially CommonSense-Robots task.
#### This repository summarizes following researches.

## Research list
* Bootstrap Your Own Skills: Learning to Solve New Tasks with Large Language Model Guidance (CoRL 2023 Oral) - Jesse Zhang, Jiahui Zhang, Karl Pertsch, Ziyi Liu, Xiang Ren, Minsuk Chang, Shao-Hua Sun, and Joseph J. Lim.

  * The proposed BOotStrapping your own Skills (BOSS), is an approach that automatically learns to solve new long-horizon, complex, and meaningful tasks by growing a learned skill library with minimal supervision. BOSS learns to accomplish new tasks by performing "skill bootstrapping", where an agent with a set of primitive skills interacts with the environment to practice new skills without receiving reward feedback for tasks outside of the initial skill set.
 
* SPRINT: Scalable Policy Pre-Training via Language Instruction Relabeling (ICRA 2024) - Jesse Zhang, Karl Pertsch, Jiahui Zhang, and Joseph J. Lim.

  * The proposed SPRINT(Scalable Pre-training via Relabeling Language INsTructions) is an approach that allows automatic expansion of a base set of pre-training tasks, resulting in a significanly broader skill repertoire. SPRINT leverages two core ideas: instruction relabeling via LLMs and cross-trajectory skill chaining through offline reinforcement learning.
